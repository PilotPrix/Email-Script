Hi $NAME!

My name is Peter, I am a high school student and the outreach lead for Highlander Engineering this year. Currently, we are planning on hosting the Highlander Engineering Challenge, a hackathon-style event, in which over 200+ students across Waterloo will be building projects in teams and competing with other high schools. The event will be hosted from May 4 to June 30th.

We were wondering if you would like to host a workshop or AMA with our students. You could talk about work you've done or a topic with respect to your profession. We believe the students will appreciate having you in our club.

have also attached our speaker information sheet where you can learn more about what it is like to be a guest speaker at Highlander Engineering.

Looking forward to hearing from you!


Kind regards,
Peter
